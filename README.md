# Extended Bogeys
[Forge & Fabric 1.20.1] A mod that adds many new bogey types to the [Create Mod](https://modrinth.com/mod/create)

## Features
#### Currently includes a large amount of custom bogeys
- Bogeys added:
	- Large Drivers: **_0-4-0 to 0-12-0_**
 	- Extra Large Drivers: **_0-4-0 to 0-10-0_**
	- Extra Large Create Styled Drivers: **_0-2-0 to 0-8-0_** 
	- Small Trailing Bogeys: **_0-2-0 to 0-6-0_**
	- Small Standard Bogeys: **_0-6-0 to 0-10-0_**

 _**Medium Bogeys and Large Create styled drivers have been moved to [Steam n' Rails](https://modrinth.com/mod/create-steam-n-rails) in v1.6.1**_
 
#### Bogeys can be rotated when right clicked with an empty hand, useful for a variety of builds
- Bogeys that are able to rotate:
	- Large Drivers
   	- Extra Large Drivers

#### You can also unlink bogeys by crouch right clicking the top of the bogey, unlinking allows for a bogey to be seperated from the track and can be glued onto a train like a normal block
- Bogeys that are able to be unlinked (extra large is currently not working):
  	- Small Bogeys
  	- Large Bogeys
